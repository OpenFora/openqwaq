Message Of The Day - System Announcements

We can display a popup text message to all users in an organization, 
or everyone across all of Forums.

The MOTD will be seen by connected and incoming clients
until it is removed or it expires.
A message can be given an expires date inside the message file.

The MOTD presents to users in a simple floating window.
It appears during login to incoming users, as a pop-up to connected users.

The MOTD is set up by creating one of the following files
on the service provider.

	-realms- / system-resources / system-notice.txt
		for global announcements

	-realms- / some-organization / updates / host-notice.txt
		for announcements to users in that organization

If there is a system-level global announcement, it takes precedence.
If there is a system announcement, per-org MOTD's will not be seen
until the system announcement file is removed.

This means individual organizations can have an 'ordinary' MOTD,
while a system notice will take precedence when published.

The MOTD, after being set up by creating the above file,
is shown to each newly-arriving user during login,
and is also shown to users already already logged in within a few minutes (usually 2).

Basic Use for Urgent Service Announcements

To announce urgent or impending service issues, 
one would post a simple text notice as the file 
	-realms- / system-resources / system-notice.txt
After about 3 or 4 minutes, all active users will have seen this.

Remove the when the notice is no longer wanted.


Message File Format

The system-notice.txt (and/or the organization host-notice.txt) 
can be either plain text or XML.  

If text, the entire content is shown to the user 
as the text of the notice window.
Any time the file is not a valid XML body it is handled this way.
(Errors in your XML will make the XML appear in the notice.)

If XML, it uses the following tags:

<message>
<text> 
The literal text of the message.  Mandatory.
</text>

... the remaining XML tags are optional controls ....

<title>The title of the notice dialog</title>

<minVersion>Qwaq Forums 1.1.72</minVersion>
	would mean that users of 1.1.64 would -not- see the message

<maxVersion>QwaqForums 1.1.88</maxVersion>
	would mean that users of 1.1.92 would -not- see the message

<expires>2008-08-03T09:54:22-07:00 </expires>
	no one will be shown the message after this date/time

<effective>2008-08-03T09:54:22-07:00</effective>
	no one will be shown the message before this date/time

<onceOnly>true</onceOnly>
	If set true, the message is shown to a user only once, not at each login.
	Default is false - MOTD's are shown at each login.

</message>
