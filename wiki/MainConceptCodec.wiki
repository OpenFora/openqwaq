Q: Why do WebCam and Video streaming not work in OpenQwaq?

A: For the open source release we had to remove the proprietary H.264 and AAC codecs. We hope the community will help us to come up with suitable open source replacements.

= Details =

The original codecs used are from [http://www.mainconcept.com MainConcept].

The features of OpenQwaq which use this codec are:

 * Webcam
 * MP4 Movie Playback
 * Session Recording
 
Please visit the MainConcept licensing pages to determine what kind of license is required, should you wish to use these codecs.
