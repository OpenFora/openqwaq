#summary One-Detailed installation instructions for enabling secure SSL login to OQ Admin pages.

= Introduction =

For security reasons, it's best to login to the OpenQwaq Admin pages using the secure HTTPS protocol. I took a stab at this and have been able to get it to work a couple times by implementing the directions verbatim (copy-and-paste recommended!). 
<p>
Notes:<br>
-- this is an alternative to a Verisign-type certificate, saving you $$$<br>
-- your firewall needs to open up port 8443 for this to work<br>
-- the browser will bark at you for the self-signed key but since it's just your own admin pages your customers won't see it so shouldn't be a problem<br>
-- copy-and-paste the lines that don't have the # comment symbol<br>
-- cobbled together from various sources, including Ron T. and Patrick (thanks to both)<br>

Feel free to try it out and let me know if there's any issues or typos.

Good luck!

= Details =

# 0. gain root access to your server<br>
# ===========================================<br>
# depends on how your server and ssh login works:<br>
# can either be password-less root login (not recommended)<br>
# or login as openqwaq and "sudo su" to root (saves sudo-ing the commands)<br>

# 1. install prerequisite components<br>
# ===========================================<br>
# these may already be installed from step 1 of the OQ installation instructions, but just in case:<br>
<b>yum install mod_ssl</b><br>
<b>yum install openssl</b><br>

# 2. enable https connections<br>
# ===========================================<br>
# make a symbolic link to the OpenQwaq-https.conf file<br>
ln -s /home/openqwaq/server/etc/OpenQwaq-https.conf /etc/httpd/conf.d/OpenQwaq-https.conf<br>
# edit the OpenQwaq-https.conf file<br>
vi /home/openqwaq/server/etc/OpenQwaq-https.conf<br>
# change the ServerName from openqwaq.openqwaq.org to YOUR_SERVER_NAME or YOUR_SERVER_IP<br>
# change "loadlhost" typo in file (not sure if needed but why not?):<br>
# change "Allow from loadlhost.localdomain" to "Allow from localhost.localdomain"<br>
# make sure that the # SSL cert/key line after VirtualHost *:8443 reads:<br>
# SSLCertificateFile /home/openqwaq/server/etc/keys/openqwaq.com.crt<br>
# SSLCertificateKeyFile /home/openqwaq/server/etc/keys/openqwaq.com.key.insecure<br>
# note: these file names must match those created in Step #4 below<br>

# 3. generate the necessary keys and certificates<br>
# ===========================================<br>
# navigate to keys directory (not necessary to be in this directory but I like to work here)<br>
cd /home/openqwaq/server/etc/keys<br>
# generate private key<br>
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 1024 <br>
# note: when I used 4096 it didn't work, perhaps for 32-bit reasons (?)<br>

# generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR)<br>
openssl req -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr<br>

# generate self-signed key<br>
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -out ca.crt<br>

# 4. copy the files to correct location<br>
# ===========================================<br>
cp ca.crt /home/openqwaq/server/etc/keys/openqwaq.com.crt<br>
cp ca.key /home/openqwaq/server/etc/keys/openqwaq.com.key.insecure<br>

# 5. set admin username and password to what you want<br>
# ===========================================<br>
# option a: create a new user and assign password<br>
htdigest /home/openqwaq/server/etc/OpenQwaq-digests 'OpenQwaq Server Admin Pages' someNewUserName<br>
# you will be prompted to enter and confirm the password<br>
# option b: change the password on an existing user<br>
htpasswd /home/openqwaq/server/etc/OpenQwaq-digests someExistingUserName<br>
# you will be prompted to enter and confirm the password<br>

# 6. restart apache<br>
# ===========================================<br>
/etc/init.d/httpd restart<br>

# 7. test it out by going to the admin web page<br>
# ===========================================<br>
https://YOUR_IP:8443/admin/<br>
# enter username and password and hopefully you're in!<br>
