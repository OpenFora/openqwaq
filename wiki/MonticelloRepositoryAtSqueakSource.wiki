#summary Explains the purpose of the Monticello Repository at SqueakSource.

= Introduction =

Monticello is a Smalltalk Repository used for developing code in Squeak.  When you make changes it automatically tracks changes, allows you to merge others changes, and keeps a local copy of the code you work with.  Although most Squeak Community Members know about Monticello other may not so I thought I would post the information here.

There has been a www.SqueakSource.com Monticello repository created to facilitate a squeak image build.  The results of submissions will be merged by responsible community members to build a Squeak Smalltalk Image for a client and a server.  The images will be posted back to the Community here on Google Code.  


= Details =
The Monticello repository is used for building the image and contains the Smalltalk code.  The SVN repository contains everything else: Smalltalk images (client and server), linux code, dll's (source and binary), C code, plugin code, VM build structure, documentation, python, web applications and a bunch more stuff that is needed to build OpenQWAQ.

If you would like to be added to the SqueakSource repository so that you can submit changes please send a request to the google OpenQWAQ list for consideration.  Also if you would like to be added as a member to this group you should also do the same.

We look forward to working with you!  Welcome to OpenQWAQ!
