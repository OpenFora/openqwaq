This image is intended to build new CoInterpreter CogVMs.The following doit creates a single source tree (../src) for all three platforms.  Since it uses a relative path it will work out of the box.  Generate the entire VM using it.	(VMMaker		generate: CoInterpreter		to: (FileDirectory default pathFromURI: '../src')		platformDir: (FileDirectory default pathFromURI: '../platforms')		excluding:#(			BrokenPlugin DShowVideoDecoderPlugin IA32ABIPluginSimulator			NewsqueakIABIPlugin NewsqueakIABIPluginAttic			QuicktimePlugin QVideoCodecPlugin QwaqMediaPlugin			SlangTestPlugin TestOSAPlugin FFIPlugin "i.e. include ThreadedIA32FFIPlugin"			ThreadedFFIPlugin ThreadedARMFFIPlugin ThreadedPPCBEFFIPlugin			Win32OSProcessPlugin		))To generate a single plugin you can use the Generic VMMaker above.  You may have to delete plugin files to get the above to regenerate them.  The timestamp stuff is flakey.To rebuild this image...- start with a Teleplace dev image (this started life as Teleplace-3.5.39.image)1. load SharedPool-Speech from Homebase2. Load VMMaker from Homebase3. Load Qwaq-Plugins from Qwaq4. Load Qwaq-VMProfiling-Plugins from Qwaq5. Load Alien-VMMaker-Plugins from Homebase6. Load VMConstruction-Plugins-OSProcessPlugin (seriously) from ThirdParty7. Load Cog from Homebase (for the BochsIA32Plugin for Cogit development/generation)- optionally open a VMMaker and set it up for cross-platform generation.  This can be useful for generating individual plugins.- flush monticello caches: (MCFileBasedRepository flushAllCaches)- optionally clean the image, condense changes and save
