This directory contains Yoshiki Ohshima's DShowVideoPlugin, as obtained from http://www.is.titech.ac.jp/~ohshima/squeak/DShowVideo/index.html on September 26, 2007.

You can find the HTML page above as 'index.html' in this directory.  It provides build instructions, etc.  

The files DShowVideoDecoderPluginSource.zip and dshowlib1.0.1.zip are exactly those downloaded from Yoshiki's site.  The similarly-named directorys were created by unzipping these files; the contained source files may have been subsequently modified by us.

Eventually, we want to integrate DirectShow functionality into QwaqMediaPlugin.  But for now, we're using Yoshiki's plugin separately.
