This directory contains the files necessary for building a
Debian package for repro. Currently, we are building a single
package containing a statically linked version of repro. This
will change in the future with extra packages for resip, repro,
etc.

In order to make this work, you have to copy the debian directory
one level up, ie., from ./repro/debian to ./debian and then run
dpk-buildpackage in that directory. You may also use the source
package available from <http://www.sipfoundry.org/pub/repro/>.
