= Release Notes v 1.6 =

==General==
===New features===
* new clicktocall project
* new ichat to SIP gateway project
* adding Tarasenko Volodymyr's autotools macro for use in external projects

==Build system==
===New features===
* auto-detect c-ares headers/libs, both for in-place builds, and installed headers
* added VS2010 project files

===Bug fixes===
* added missing LEAK_CHECK defines to windows DEBUG builds of dum, resiprocate and rutil
* if popt is in a default location, don't include it with -I and -L
* added missing AresCompat.hxx (in rutil VS 9.0 project file)

==rutil==
===New features===
* added ParseBuffer::skipBackToOneOf()
* added ability to createLocalLogger instances, and assign these instances to threads (Thanks to Alexander Chemeris)

===Bug fixes===
* remove spurious boost include
* override std::exception::what() in BaseException, so we actually get a usable error if we don't catch one
* stop asserting if we get an empty DNS response, and implemented handling code for this case

==stack==
===New features===
* define Remote-Party-Id header as a multi header
* change from Gregor Jasny to be tolerant of rtpmap lines missing the rate parameter
* new generic DigestStream class for any openSSL digest
* change to allow XMLCursor to parse an XML document with no prolog
* change to SDP parser to be tolerant of whitespace following the codec id on the m line
* added Uri::getAorNoReally() which actually returns the AoR as defined by RFC 3261
* send 503 to TU instead of 408 if DNS times out
* better reason phrases when timeouts occur
* changes to resip stack to allow passing a port of 0 into addTransport interface to allow OS to choose an appropriate port number

===Bug fixes===
* some fixes to the sigcomp code
* fixing a few params to be quoted-string instead of non-quoted data (vendor, model, and version)
* don't call encode twice on bodies (major inefficiency, but didn't really result in bad behavior)
* replace a couple of static objects with member objects, so we don't have problems with multiple SipStacks in the same process
* close connected-UDP sockets (used by TransportSelector to query the routing table when we haven't explicitly specified what interface we want to use when sending) on teardown; allows a single process to create and destroy SipStacks repeatedly without leaking fds (mainly for unit-tests)
* stop sitting around on our thumbs for 200ms when DNS processing needs to be done
* removed incorrect Q value compare fn in Uri class - q-value is a contact/name-addr parameter, not a uri parameter
* fix issue with logging errno after SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in TlsConnection
* moved various fn local static variables to file level static variables to avoid multi-threaded first call runtime race conditions with initializing local static variables

==DUM==
===New features===
* patch from Chris Brody so that the tests will build if not using POPT
* added "invariant" reason code from 3265bis00 (for subscriptions)
* change optional RWMutex parameter to Lockable base type in dum::process to allow other types of Mutex's to be passed in

===Bug fixes===
* fix bug where wrong terminated reason is sent in callback when receiving a CANCEL
* ClientInviteSession changes to react appropriately to reception of UPDATE messages before connected state
* always allow reject to be called after onOffer - adding case where offer comes in 2xx response after invite with no sdp - ACK 200, then BYE session
* fix to UAC handling to be able to handle sending ACK then BYE when a CANCEL request crosses a 200/Inv.  This fix handles the case when we don't have any formed dialogs at the time of cancel
* fixed bug where DialogSet::ifMatch() would not work for resubscribes
* don't tear down server subscriptions when the app sends an error response that implies either an optional retry-after, or implies application-dependent behavior
* fixed RedirectManager Q-Value ordering function - it was looking for q-value as a uri parameter - also changed to treat no q-value as q=1.0
* ensure auth headers are cleared out before retrying client registration
* fixing a bug with Glare timers if we placed the call (UAC) - they were not being properly dispatched to InviteSession
* use supported mimetype for subscriptions in NOTIFY messages instead of SUBSCRIBE messages
* stop using UPDATE for confirmed dialogs, since it is recommended against in RFC 3311
* fixed a bug in client subscription if AppDialogSet's are used, and a retry is attempted
* fixed a ClientSubscription bug when retrying - not reusing profile used in original subscription setup
* fixed a difficult to find, and long standing memory leak bug in ClientSubscriptions
* added handling to ClientRegistration for strange border case where registrar returns an Expires header of 0 after attempting to register
 
==repro==
===New features===
* some logging improvements
* better description of defaults for command-line options
* modification to repro so that contacts without a q-value are treated as having q=1.0
* changes to repro to allow Registration, and Publish/Subscribe forwarding to other domains

===Bug fixes===
* actual Proxy-Require support (yeah, yeah, about time, I know)
* reject requests with a garbage next-hop Route header immediately, instead of having the stack complain when we try to forward
* various bugfixes related to outbound
* ignore user-part of topmost Route header if it doesn't parse as a flow-token

==reTurn==
===New features===
* pad the content of the SOFTWARE header so that we are on a 4 byte boundary for size (prevents STUN messages from reTurn showing up in Wireshark as malformed packets)

===Bug fixes===
* fix a couple of spots where we try to erase from mActiveRequestMap using an invalidated iterator
* fixed a bug in processTurnAllocateRequest that led to reTurnServer giving "unauthorized" errors

==recon==

===Bug fixes===
* recon memory leak fixes - thanks to Julio Cabezas
* update to recon VS2008/2005/2003 solution files for sipXtapi rev 11413 with speex update
* allow recon to properly reject media lines with unknown media types and protocols
* fixup sdp direction attribute in our offers in scenarios where we are being held by the other party
* fix UserProfile selection when receiving refer with no subscription
* make sure our ReferTo header doesn't have tags in it
