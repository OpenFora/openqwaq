Netxx Examples

Any of the examples in this directory that take address options can use the
URL syntax for an address. For example, to run the tcp_echo_server on port
7000:

    ./tcp_echo_server localhost:7000

Or, to make it use a local domain socket:

    ./tcp_echo_server /tmp/echo.socket

Have fun!
