    <description>
	<para>
	     Netxx is a C++ network programming library. It is designed to
	     take the pain out of programming network communications
	     applications.
	 </para>

	 <para>
	     It does this by providing an easy to use and cross-platform
	     interface. As a side effect, you get the safety of automatic
	     resource management and smaller, simpler code.
	</para>

    <features>
	<feature>
	    Very clean API with total abstraction from any operating system calls.
	    No networking or operating system headers are used in the Netxx header files.
	</feature>

	<feature>
	    Appropriate use of C++ technologies such as namespaces, templates, inheritance and exceptions. All Netxx
	    classes are in the Netxx namespace and exceptions are used only in exceptional situations.
	</feature>

	<feature>
	    Includes support for TLS/SSL (via OpenSSL), IPv6 and Local/Unix Domain Sockets (on operating systems that support
	    them).
	</feature>

	<feature>
	    Cross-platform support. Netxx currently supports most flavors of Unix, Windows and MacOS X.
	</feature>

	<feature>
	    An IOStreams streambuf is provided so you can treat network connections just like a std::iostream.
	</feature>

	<feature>
	    Berkeley style license so you can do whatever you want with Netxx, including commercial use.
	</feature>
    </features>
