		The Netxx::Address class uses gethostbyname and on most
		unix-like operating systems that function is NOT thread
		safe. I am currently looking at ways to get around this. I
		know that some systems supply gethostbyname_r but not all
		do.

		Of course there is no support for local domain sockets on
		Win32. At some point I will add code for doing windows
