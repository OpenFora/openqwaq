Todo List
Todo Before 1.0.0 Release

  * Remove any calls to malloc with calls to new char[]. (Peer.cxx).
   
  * use SUN_LEN instead of sizeof for AF_LOCAL;
   
  * Separate the inet_ntop and inet_pton implementations into their own
    files.
   
  * Have a separate file for OS stuff, like os_starup, os_finish,
    os_get_error, os_set_error.
   
  * Clean up documentation and make more complete.
   
  * Add Solaris >= 8 /dev/poll support to the Probe class.
   
  * Add thread callbacks for OpenSSL.
   
  * Call THREADS_init() if initializing OpenSSL.
   
  * Add more callbacks to TLS::Context so that developers can better
    customize TLS behavior.
   
  * Verify what WSAETIMEDOUT and WSAEMSGSIZE mean.
   
  * Optimize Netxx::Netbuf::xsputn().
   
  * Add support for the FreeBSD kqueue(2) function in Probe_impl.
   
  * Should Netxx::Peer::operator<< print out something different for
    AF_LOCAL?
   
  * Should we allow some way to get user credentials from a local domain
    socket?
   
  * TLS::handle_shutdown should be more robust and support non-blocking
    sockets.
   
  * How should we handle file permissions for local domain sockets? Right
    now we set them to 0666. There should be some way for the developer to
    override this. Maybe using a fake port, e.g., /some/file:0600?
   
  * Add another callback to the Context class so that we can verify certs.
