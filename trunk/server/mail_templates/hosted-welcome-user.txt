Additional Info

More than one Organization:

     Your user account can be a member of more than one organization within OpenQWAQ.  You'll see all the organizations you're a member of in the dropdown on the OpenQWAQ sign in screen right after login.  Organizations are like buildings.  People in the same building can easily share resources and access common Forums.  They can see who is logged into the Organization, and private chat others (like instant messaging) even if the person is in another room.
                  
Inviting Others:
                  
	Not everyone is allowed to invite users but if the invite new user button is active (under the people list on the right side of the client) you can press it to invite new users.  All you need is their email address.  Administrators in your organization will be CC'd on the invitation.
