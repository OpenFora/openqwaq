How to Build the Teleplace VM on Windows
----------------------------------
1. Install the tools:
- Install cygwin from www.cygwin.com.  As of writing the VM is built using
CYGWIN_NT-5.1 mcstalkerxp 1.5.24(0.156/4/2) 2007-01-31 10:57 i686 Cygwin
using gcc version 3.4.4 (cygming special, gdc 0.12, using dmd 0.125)
2. Check out the following sources from svn
     svn co https://dev.qwaq.com/svn/qwaqvm/trunk/platforms
     svn co https://dev.qwaq.com/svn/qwaqvm/trunk/src
     svn co https://dev.qwaq.com/svn/qwaqvm/trunk/cygwinbuild
3. Open a cygwin bash shell, cd into the cygbuild directory and execute
     make
4. At the end of this process you should have a brand new Teleplace VM in the
   cygwinbuild/build/vm folder (make sure you transfer Teleplace.map,
   SqueakFFIPrims.dll and PyBridge.dll along with it)


Caution: if you previously used the mingw gnutools approach, you probably have
a path to that 2.x gcc in your Windows PATH.  Make sure that 'which gcc' in
cygwin is the cygwin gcc 3.4.x not the MinGW gcc 2.95.x (try gcc -v).

Caution 2: This procedure does *not* build all the DLLs/shared libraries
that are delivered with the Teleplace client.  For example QAudioPlugin.dll
is built elsewhere.  If you need a fully populated sandbox to for your test 
build you should "svn export" the appropriate qwaqvm-binary directory 
and put your new files in their new location.


3a. The cygwin makefile supports building three VM configurations, product,
    assert and debug, building product by default.  The configurations are
	product: stripped  & unstripped production VMs optimized at -O2 in
		build/vm/Teleplace.exe
		build/vm/TeleplaceUnstripped.exe
	assert: an unstripped VM that includes assertion checks optimized at -O1 in
		buildast/vm/Teleplace.exe
	debug: an unstripped, unoptimized VM that includs assertion checks
		builddbg/vm/Teleplace.exe
    Note that even the stripped production VM can be used for debug using the
	unstripped VM to provide symbols, e.g.
		U:\ gdb bin/Teleplace.exe
		...
		(no debugging symbols found)
		(gdb) file TeleplaceUnstripped.exe
		(gdb) run trunk.image

	In fact there is an additional VM alongside each Teleplace VM, e.g.
		build/vm/TeleplaceConsole.exe
	This VM is a Windows "console" application which will run inside an MSDOS
	console window.  When the I/O code in 
		platforms/win32/plugins/FilePlugin/sqWin32FilePrims.c
	supports it this VM will be able to read and write to stdin and stdout.
