/**
 * BasicNonceHelper implements the makeNonce function in the same way
 * as the original implementation of makeNonce within Helper.cxx
 *
 * To operate a farm/cluster of UASs/proxies, you must:
 * a) make sure the clocks are sychronized (using ntpd for instance)
 * b) use the same privateKey value on every instance of the application
 *
 * To operate with SER, use the SERNonceHelper instead, as that generates
 * the nonce string the same way as SER.  You must also observe the same
 * conditions above regarding clock and key synchronization.
