/**
@mainpage The reSIProcate Utility Library (rutil)

The reSIProcate Utility (rutil) library provides various utility classes for use by the resip stack and Dialog Usage Manager. In some cases, these utility classes are used to provide cross-platform implementations of important system-level stuff; see resip::ThreadIf, resip::Mutex, resip::Lock, resip::Condition, resip::Random, and resip::Timer. In other cases, these classes are an alternative to commonly used classes defined in the stl (resip::Data being an alternative for a std::string). In addition, reSIProcate's DNS subsystem is part of rutil.

Generally speaking, you will not find anything even tangentially related to SIP in rutil. For this, you need to look at the reSIProcate stack, or Dialog Usage Manager.
