to initialize a mysql database to an empty state, run the following commands:

   mysql -u $user -p$pass $dbname < Users.sql
   mysql -u $user -p$pass $dbname < Resources.sql

these assume that you have an alias bound for mysql, or you have added the
mysql /bin directory to your path.

you should also replace $user and $pass with the username and 
password you want to use to create the tables.  

I recommend creating a separate database for the repro tables (called, 
creatively, "repro" in my case) and locating them there.  In any case, the
name of the database you want to use should be passed as the third argument
$dbname.

Note -- there is no space between the -p and the $pass.  If you put a space
there, mysql will choke.
