USING REPRO
This guide describes briefly how to get started using repro.  For help 
compiling or installing repro, please see the INSTALL file.

1) Run repro
Run the executable from the command line.  A number of command line options 
are available.  For a summary of options run repro with the help option:

%repro --help

%

Running the proxy server with the default options is fine.  If you are 
troubleshooting, we recommend that you enable DEBUG level logging:

% ./repro -v DEBUG


2) Access the WebAdmin pages
Now access the HTTP WebAdmin. The WebAdmin run on port 5080 by default, or a 
specific port if you specified it on the command line with the "--http" 
command-line option.

Login for the first time with the initial username: admin and the password 
"admin".

3) Add domains
You must add at least one "domain" before you can use the proxy server. The 
domains are names that the proxy recognizes after the at-sign (@) in the 
SIP URI. The list of domains is used by the proxy and the registrar to decide 
if repro is responsible for SIP requests it receives.  The WebAdmin also uses 
the list of domains to make sure users you add are in one of the domains.

For example, if you want the proxy to answer requests for atlanta.com, you 
need to add atlanta.com to the list of domains.  You still need to make sure 
that you configure DNS so that SIP requests for that domain resolve to repro.

If you don't have a fully qualified domain name, you can use your IP address 
as a "domain".

4) Add users
Next add users. The mandatory fields are the username and the domain.  The 
password is the SIP Digest password.

You can view the existing users from the Show Users page.

5) Make a test call
After adding a user you should try to register. You can check the status of 
the registration from the Registrations page on the WebAdmin.

6) About Routes and ACLs
Routes are used by repro to send certain requests to a particular location. 
The static routes use (POSIX-standard) regular expression to match and 
rewrite SIP URIs.  The screenshot shows an example of sending all requests 
that consist of only digits in the userpart of the SIP URI to a gateway.  
Note that to match characters that have a special meaning in regular expression
(like a "."), you need to escape these. You can also use variable substitution 
in the rewrite expression. The string inside the first set of parentheses () 
is referenced in the rewrite string as $1, the second is $2, etc.

Since it is easy to make mistakes entering regular expressions, you can test 
your static routes in the Show Routes page. Type in a SIP URI, click Test Route.
You should see the rewritten URL below.

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are not used by the proxy in this release, but will 
be used to allow unauthenticated access to relay requests and access routes in 
a future release.
