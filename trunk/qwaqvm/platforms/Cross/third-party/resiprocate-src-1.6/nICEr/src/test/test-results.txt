ICE TESTING RESULTS

In order to test the ICE stack, I gathered a non-random sample
of "representative" NATs and one machine behind one NAT. I
then attempted to establish connectivity between the sides
using ICE.


TOPOLOGY
The basic topology is as follows:

                            
                            +------------+
                            |   D-Link   |--------- STUN server 
 	     		    |   DI-604   |         192.168.223.2
                            +------------+
                           /   	          \
		      	  / 	           \
                  +------------+     +------------+
                  |    NAT-A   |     |    NAT-B   |
                  |            |     |            |
                  +------------+     +------------+
                         |                  |
                         |                  |
                  +------------+     +------------+
                  |    pce7    |     |    pce9    |
                  |            |     |            |
                  +------------+     +------------+
              10.0.0.107 |                  | 10.0.0.109
                         +------------------+
                                   |
                                   | 10.0.0.2
                            +------------+
                            | Controller |
                            |            |
                            +------------+

The D-Link DI-604 was used purely as a DHCP server to automatically
assign addressed to each NAT. The NATs were configured as DHCP clients
and acted as DHCP servers for the hosts behind them. The hosts were
configured to use 10.0.0/24 as a control network for two purposes:

- To exchange the offer and answer
- To start and stop tests.

However, the ICE stack was configured not to use this interface,
as our basic regression tests test two-hosts behind the same 
NAT topologies.

No TURN server was used.


NATS TESTED
We tested the following NATs (types from [J07])

NAT                                             Type
---------------------------------------------------------------
Dynex DXE-401                                    Full Cone
Linksys NR041 (rev 1.0.3)                       Symmetric
Netgear FVS318                                  Port Restricted
Linksys NR041 (rev 1.0.2)                       Addr Restricted
Airlink AOHO4P                                  Port Restricted
D-Link DI-704P                                  Full Cone

We believe these NATs were reasonably representative of the
major available types.


TEST METHODOLOGY
The tests were run using "ice_test" and the "test-ice.pl" script in
ICE/test. The configuration files were "test-remote-ekr.conf" and
"set-config-ekr.pl".

For each network configuration we performed two tests:

- pce9 as offerer in regular nomination mode
- pce9 as offerer in aggressive nomination mode
- pce7 as offerer in regular nomination mode
- pce7 as offerer in aggressive nomination mode

This allowed us to test both directions with a single configuration.

13	  Linksys NR041 (1.0.3)   Linksys NR041 (1.0.2)   Success


Notes: *ed tests were performed with a Netgear RT314 as the outer
       DHCP server
       Test 4 was abandoned because the planned NAT, a Hawking,
       didn't seem to work at all (i.e., wouldn't issue addresses
       or pass any traffic.)
