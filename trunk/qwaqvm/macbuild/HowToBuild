How to Build the Teleplace VM on MacOS
--------------------------------
1. Install the tools (xcode etc);
   then install the Intel C++ compiler 11.1
   (You can forgo the Intel Compiler, 
   which may require changing 'Rules' in the XCode project,
   although XCode will default to gcc4.2 I think.)

2. Install Python 2.4.3 (from python.org)
3. Check out the following sources from svn
     svn co https://source.qwaq.com/svn/qwaqvm/trunk/platforms
     svn co https://source.qwaq.com/svn/qwaqvm/trunk/macbuild
4. Open a shell, cd into the macbuild directory and execute
     ./makevm
5. At the end of this process you should have a brand new Teleplace.app
   in the macbuild folder (which does include Python support)
