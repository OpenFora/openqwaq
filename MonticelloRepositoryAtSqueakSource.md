# Introduction #

Monticello is a Smalltalk Repository used for developing code in Squeak.  When you make changes it automatically tracks changes, allows you to merge others changes, and keeps a local copy of the code you work with.

There has been a [Squeaksource.com](http://www.squeaksource.com/openqwaq.html) Monticello repository created to facilitate a squeak image build.  The results of submissions will be merged by responsible community members to build a Squeak Smalltalk Image for a client and a server.  The images will be posted back to the Community here on Google Code.

# Details #

The Monticello repository is used for building the image and contains the Smalltalk code.  The Google SVN repository contains everything else:
  * Smalltalk images (client and server)
  * Linux code
  * DLL's (source and binary)
  * C code
  * Plugin code
  * VM build structure
  * Documentation
  * Python
  * Web applications
  * A bunch more stuff that is needed to build OpenQwaq.

If you would like to be added to the SqueakSource repository so that you can submit changes please send a request to the [Google OpenQwaq Group](mailto:openqwaq@googlegroups.com) for consideration.  Also if you would like to be added as a member to this group you should [join here.](http://groups.google.com/group/openqwaq)

We look forward to working with you!  Welcome to OpenQwaq!
