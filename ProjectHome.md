## Introduction ##

A highly-secure, enterprise-class virtual collaboration platform.  OpenQwaq is built on [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org/), and is the next step in delivering solutions using the [Croquet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquet_Project) shared instruction model.

Like offices and meeting rooms, OpenQwaq Forums are places where users can go to work, to collaborate with others, and to identify and solve issues.  Whether you are working internally with other team members and groups, or need to collaborate with supply chain partners or customers, OpenQwaq has powerful features that simplify setting up and working in highly collaborative environments.  More details can be found [below.](#Details.md)


## Overview ##

OpenQwaq provides Forums for online workspaces with all the tools, data, and interactivity that people need to explore ideas, resolve issues, track progress, and be more productive. Easy to set up, highly participatory, always available and secure, OpenQwaq Forums provide a spatial context that fosters new levels of communication, creativity, problem-solving, and efficiency.

It is a highly-secure, enterprise-class virtual collaboration platform that has been used by large commercial enterprises and federal agencies. OpenQwaq enables organizations - large and small, profit and not-for-profit - to implement virtual workspaces for their specific needs.

OpenQwaq is based on the [Teleplace](http://www.teleplace.com/) technology platform that has been in the market since 2007.  [3D ICC](http://3dicc.com) purchased and currently owns OpenQwaq and offers a commercial version called Terf tm.

  * **Drag-and-drop content.** Content is easily made available to users; simply drag and drop content from your local folders or desktop into OpenQwaq and it will be automatically uploaded and made available to other users. Share information contained in corporate applications or desktop applications such as Adobe® PDF documents, Microsoft® Word, Powerpoint, and Excel files, images, and even 3-D content by dragging files from local or network folders and dropping into an OpenQwaq virtual workspace.

  * **Immediate interactivity.** Using OpenQwaq Multi-Share, multiple users can edit content together within a virtual space. All participants see edits in real-time. Once a work item is completed, content can be saved to your local desktop or folders for further processing.

  * **Always available.** OpenQwaq Forums are available all the time. Participants can work with others in real time or go to a Forum at any other time and see the changes made by other team members since you were there last.

  * **Highly immersive.** Unlike traditional 2-D collaboration environments, OpenQwaq's 3-D environment provides strong feedback that enhances teamwork and communication. Using avatars and unique "laser pointer" controls, participants can easily see where people are, what they are looking at, what content they are editing, and how they are using applications. In combination with OpenQwaq's built-in high fidelity VoIP, webcam video-conferencing and text chat, users have a highly immersive environment and important social cues that help them learn and work more effectively.

  * **Persistence.** The virtual spaces in OpenQwaq are designed to be dynamic and evolving. Users can save the state of an OpenQwaq virtual space at any time. The saved state includes any editing made by users to documents or content in the space; for example, if you had been working on a budgeting spreadsheet, any changes you and other users made to that spreadsheet would be saved along with the rest of the state of the virtual space. This capability provides a powerful way for users to work on projects that cannot be completed in one session and allows them to leave incremental work updates for each other when working asynchronously.

  * **Simple virtual workspace creation.** Create meeting rooms, offices, lab rooms or other indoor spaces from existing room templates. The templates provide ready-to-use rooms that can be used right away or further customized. Use the OpenQwaq Virtual Campus to create outdoor spaces. All spaces can be linked together using drag and drop commands.
